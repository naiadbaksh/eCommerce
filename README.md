# eCommerce
A fully fleshed out eCommerce application using React. The site employs React class and functional components, React hooks, Sass and eventually styled components. I used Redux to be able to use state throughout the app to feed data to components without having to "prop drill". The payment processing employs Stripe integration, and the database is a Firebase Firestore. Authentication was done with OAuth2.
